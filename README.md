# User_data
I have used Express JS to create REST APIs and NOSQL database i.e., MongoDB. Visual Studio code is used to write the code.Postman version 7.0.7 is used to run the queries of APIs . I have used Robo 3T 1.2.1 to store database and it is connected with MongoDB and APIs. Initialise the project by npm init. inittialise MongoDB by npm install mongoose. 
File structer goes as:  
Assignment folder 
      - UserData
           -> app.js
 app.js is the file where all APIs are created.
